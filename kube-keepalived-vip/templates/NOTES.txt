Installing Virtual IP for your kubernetes services.

To verify if everything is working you can check the `kube-keepalived-vip` pod is in each node of the cluster.

For example:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
echoheaders-co4g4           1/1       Running   0          5m
kube-keepalived-vip-a90bt   1/1       Running   0          53s
kube-keepalived-vip-g3nku   1/1       Running   0          52s
kube-keepalived-vip-gd18l   1/1       Running   0          54s
```

And then:
```
$ kubectl logs kube-keepalived-vip-a90bt
```

You can also verify the generated vrrp configuration with the following command (replace the pod name):
```
$ kubectl exec kube-keepalived-vip-a90bt cat /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
```
